* burndown -- Charting for agile projects

  Uses [[https://github.com/mbostock/d3]] to generate burn-down charts from org-mode
  project Effort estimates and CLOCKSUM time log data.  The historical "Effort"
  (estimate) and "CLOCKSUM" (work) data are collected from the Git repository,
  and rendered as Burndown charts, as per:

      http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/alt-releaseburndown

  Normal burndown charts don't differentiate betwee changes in project scope
  (adding or removing task), and progress on the project (convertings tasks from
  "todo" to "done").  The "alternative" burndown chart shows project progress by
  changes along the top of the bar chart, and changes in project scope on the
  bottom of the bar chart -- where the best-fit lines meet is where the project
  is likely to be finished.

  By separating the two concepts, it is absolutely clear where changes in the
  project finish originate; either due to changes in work progress, or changes
  in project scope.

** Finish Day/Date Projection

   The project is going to finish A) after a certain number of project Days of
   effort, and B) on a certain calendar Date.  These are somewhat independent,
   since the amount of work applied to the project changes over time (holidays,
   changes in staffing, etc.)

   To compute the Project's finish Day, we use a best-fit curve to project the
   intersection of the Project's progress and change lines.  Based on the
   burndown style selected, this reflects units of effort, units of elapsed
   time, or sprints.

   Once the finish Day is computed, we also use a best-fit line through each
   sample's actual calendar date, to predict the finish Date.  This gives us a
   correlation between each burndown unit, and calendar time.

** Burndown Styles

   Three styles of burndown chart are available.  All of these change the
   meaning of the X (time) axis.  The Y (estimate) axis always represents the
   amount of task "Effort" (estimate) remaining in the project.  By changing the
   X axis, we can see how the project is progressing as we track:

*** effort

    Tracks project "CLOCKSUM" (work) time.  Each graph X axis sample represents
    a certain number of hours of actual work on the project.  The default is 8
    hours.  This computes the project finsh "Day" based on effort-days, and a
    finish Date based on a projection of historical work Days per calendar Day.
    
*** elapsed

    Tracks calendar elapsed time.  This produces one X axis sample per calendar
    day.  Therefore, the computed project finish Day and calendar Date are
    identical.
   
*** sprint (no yet implemented)
    
    Tracks project Sprints, one sprint per sample.  Works best if your sprints
    represent roughly equal work effort, but will respond to changes in Sprint
    effort over time, in a best-fit fashion.  Predicts the number of Sprints
    remaining.

** Maintaining org-mode Project Data

  Prepare an org-mode file containing a project, in the form of a tree of TODO
  entries.  Ensure that the top-level TODO entry for the project contains a date
  entry, and put an org-mode table within it:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      * TODO Project Test <2012-03-18 Sun>    
      #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local
      | Task                                 | Effort | CLOCKSUM |
      |--------------------------------------+--------+----------|
      | * TODO Project Test <2012-03-18 Sun> |  46:00 |          |
      | ** TODO Setup                        |  10:00 |          |
      #+END:
      ** TODO Setup ...
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Each day, update the CLOCKSUM (time worked) and/or Effort (TODO estimates)
  data in the org file.  Update the top-level Project's date.  Finally, refresh
  the table (hit C-c C-c in the BEGIN: line of the data summary table), save the
  file and commit it to the Git repository.

  The orgserver will parse the project data from the specified project's .org
  files in the Git repository.  By scanning the historical contents in the Git
  commit history, a burn-down chart will be rendered.  We use d3, so make sure
  your browser supports SVG (eg. Chrome, Firefox or IE9+).

** orgserver -- Start a web.py based web and JSON API server

   Serves org-mode data from the specified org directory, for the specified
   project(s).  May be configured to update from git, and kill running server(s)
   if changes to the burndown chart implementation itself are detected.

   The running orgserver puts its python orgserver.py's PID in the org
   directory, in an orgserver.pid.##### file ending with the orgserver's own
   PID.  This is used by subsequent orgservers, to locate and terminate the
   other running orgserver.py instances.

   The options are:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       orgserver [--<option> [...]] [<project> [...]]
           --help            This help
           --verbose         Log activity
           --restart         Restart any running server   (default: no)
           --refresh         Refresh Git repositories     (default: no)
           --address <i[:p]> Bind to interface:port       (default: *:8080)
               Performs a "git pull origin master" on both the org data
               directory, and the orgserver directory.  In either case,
               if the master branch's commit changes, the orgserver will
               forcibly restart any running orgserver.py.
           --org <dir>       org-mode data Git repository (default: ~/org)
           --log <file>      Log appending onto file      (default: -)
               If not relative: (.[.]/*) to current directory, or
               absolute: (/*), we assume it's relative to the org directory
           --server <name>    Specify Web Server platform (default: web.py)
           <project>         .org files to parse          (default: project)
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The following environment variables may be set, instead of specifying the Org
   data directory and the Projects list on the command line:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ORG_PROJECTS  -- The list of project names (default: project)
   ORG_DIRECTORY -- The org directory         (default: ~/org)
   #+END_EXAMPLE


*** EXAMPLE

    Run a orgserver bound to *:8080 on the host, serving org-mode data from
    ~/org, for the project 'test' (ie. from org-data in ~/org/test.org):

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       ./orgserver --verbose --org=~/org test
   #+END_EXAMPLE

    Start (or restart) the orgserver's underlying webserver, refreshing the Org
    data (~/org) and orgserver (~/src/burndown) Git repositories.  Exits quietly
    if the orgserver is already running, and restarts it if the orgserver
    repository 'master' branch has had new commits:

       ~/src/burndown/orgserver --refresh --org=~/org some project names

    This can be set up to occur automatically (say, every 5 minues) using crontab -e:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        # minute hour mday month wday command
        # */5    *    *    *     *    $HOME/src/burndown/orgserver --refresh --log orgserver.log some project names
    #+END_EXAMPLE
